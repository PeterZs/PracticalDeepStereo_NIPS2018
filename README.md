# Practical Deep Stereo 
This repository contains refactored code for ["Practical Deep Stereo (PDS): Toward applications-friendly deep stereo matching" by Stepan Tulyakov, Anton Ivanov and Francois Fleuret](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7828-practical-deep-stereo-pds-toward-applications-friendly-deep-stereo-matching), that appeared on NeurIPS2018 as a poster.

## Troubleshooting
If one of the training scripts does not work please run all unit tests by executing `./run_unit_tests.sh`. This will help you to localize and fix bugs on your own.
